A-1 Declarations, Expressions, and Assignments
----------------------------------------------

        Compile the following program (file  A-1.c) and observe the GIMPLE dumps
        and answer  the questions below. If  you manage to finish  all questions
        quickly try to attempt the optional problem.

        Source file : A-1.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple A-1.c
        View result : vi -O A-1.c A-1.c.*.gimple
        Clear dumps : rm -f A-1.c.* A-1.o

Program
-------

	int Z;

	void main()
	{
		int a, b, c;
		int p = 6;
		int q;
		double r;

		a = 10;
		b = 20;
		c = a * b + 25;
		p = 6;
		q = Z;
		r = 34.5;
		Z = r;
		Z = Z + 1;
	}


Questions
---------

        1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
            happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
            line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?


		Answer :- Even if we declare more than one variable in a single line there is only
		one declaration per line. The global declaratives are not declared in GIMPLE as 
		they are not in the main.





        2   How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
            Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
            introduced?


	    	Answer :- The complex expression are broken down into simple operations consisting 
			  of just one operand ,by following the precedance rule in C.
			  Temporary variables are introduced when there are complex operations to be 
			  broken down into simpler operations.

        3   How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
            float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?

	    	Answer :- Floats and doubles and represented in scientific notation.When a float is 
			  assigned to a integer, first the float is type casted to a temporary 
			  variable and then assigned to the required variable.

        4   How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
            there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
            for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?

	    	Answer :- As the value of Z is to be incremented by one and stored in the same variable
			  we first have to store the incremented value in one temporary variable and then
			  reassign it to the initial variable.




            
Optional Problem
----------------

        Try to understand the underlying GIMPLE representation by looking at the
        RAW dumps:

        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-gimple-raw A-1.c
        View result : vi -O A-1.c A-1.c.*.gimple
