A-4 Arrays and Pointers
-----------------------

        In this program we observe how GCC treats arrays and pointers.

        Compile  the following  program (file  A-4.c) and  observe the  compiler
        output to answer the questions.

        Source file : A-4.c
        Compilation : gcc-4.7.2 -c -fdump-tree-cfg A-4.c
        View result : vi -O A-4.c A-4.c.*.cfg
        Clear dumps : rm -f A-4.c.* A-4.o

Program
-------

        int main()
        {
            int a[3];
            int b[] = {1, 2, 3};
            int i, *p;
            for (i=0; i<3; i++) {
                a[i] = b[i];
            }
            p = a;
            *(p + 2) = 5;
        }


Questions
---------

        1   How is array declaration and initialization handled? 
		Answer :- The arrays are first declared and then values are assigned to the elements 
			  of the array.

        2   Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
            an intermediate temporary?
	    	Answer :- GIMPLE can perform one operation at a time. Hence a temporary variable is 
			  introduced and then it is assigned the values.

        3   Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
		Answer :- Clobber is for variables that are pointers. They denote that the scope of the 
			  the variable has ended.
